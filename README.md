Integer Operations is a binary that requires you to understand how integers behave in memory and CPU. The binary has 4 levels including integer overflows, underflows and truncation. In this repo you'll find the exhaustive writeup to solve the binary as well as an auxiliar C program to help you understand what happens when addition is performed over INT_MAX or subtraction over INT_MIN.
